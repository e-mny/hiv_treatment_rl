# Optimizing HIV Treatment with Reinforcement Learning

Restarting a project that my friends and I did for a hackathon, but seeing if there is anything we could've done better. Old project can be found [here](https://github.com/e-mny/mlda_docdiagx)

## Data

This dataset is designed to support the Health Data Analytics (HDAT) courses at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), offering students hands-on experience with synthetic datasets that closely mimic real-world scenarios.

It consists of 534,960 records across 15 columns, stored in CSV format with a total size of 39.1 MB. The data represents 8,916 synthetic patients tracked over 60 months, with each record summarizing one month per patient. The total number of records is the product of the number of patients and the number of months (8,916 Ã— 60).

The dataset includes 15 columns: 13 variables relevant to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV, a unique patient identifier, and a variable indicating the time point.
